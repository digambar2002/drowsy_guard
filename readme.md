# Drowsiness Detection System in Python

The Drowsiness Detection System is a Python-based application aimed at enhancing road safety by detecting driver drowsiness in real-time. This system utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to monitor and analyze facial landmarks and eye movement patterns through live video feeds from cameras.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of driver's facial features and eye behavior.
- Detection of blink frequency, eye closure duration, and head posture.
- Intelligent assessment of driver's alertness level.
- Instant alerts, alarms, or notifications for detected drowsiness.
- User-friendly interface for easy integration with vehicles.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drowsiness-detection.git`
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. genrate ssl certificate: `"C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\openssl.exe" req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 3650 `
4. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Connect a camera to capture the driver's face.
3. The system will analyze facial landmarks and eye movement in real-time.
4. If signs of drowsiness are detected, the system will trigger an alert.
